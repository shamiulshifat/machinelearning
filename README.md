# Machine learning classifification algorithms deploying on web using streamlit

In this project 3 classification algorithms invluding SVM, Random Forest and Logistic Regression are deployed on web. You can add your dataset, explore it and then feed to all three models and tune their hyper parameters and compare accuray using accuracy metrics and other plots.
good luck!
